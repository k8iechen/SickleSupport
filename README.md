# SCD Patient App

## Overview

SCD Patient App is a companion mobile app for patients that allows them to
track daily health metrics and pain crises incidents. The app will also allow
the user to quickly access resources such as links to support groups and
information about their medications and symptoms. Patients will be able to
export their health data into a standard format that can easily be shared with
their primary healthcare provider during an appointment.

# Development

The app is a React-Native app, written in TypeScript and built on top of
[Expo](expo.dev).

After checking out the project, run ```expo start``` to start the expo
environment.

Note: this project depends on `react-native-calendars` so only targets Android
and iOS.

# Team
The SCD Patient App was created by Dhvani, Mann, Sam, and Bruce.
